## Course Information:

### Overview:
This course is an introduction to deep learning. Topics include convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning. <br>Homeworks on image classification, video recognition, and deep reinforcement learning. <br>Training of deep learning models using PyTorch. <br>A large amount of GPU resources are provided to the class.
<br>Mathematical analysis of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and stochastic gradient descent algorithms will also be covered in lectures.

### Topics:
- Fully-connected and feedforward networks
- Convolution networks
- Backpropagation 
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Hyperparameter selection and parameter initialization
- Optimization algorithms (RMSprop, ADAM, momentum, etc.)
- Second-order optimization (e.g., Hessian-free optimization)
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, automatic differentiation, static versus dynamic graphs, define-by-run
- Regularization (L2 penalty, dropout, ensembles, data augmentation techniques)
- Batch normalization
- Residual neural networks
- Recurrent neural networks (LSTM and GRU networks)
- Video recognition (two-stream convolution network, 3D convolution networks, convolution networks combined with LSTM, optical flow)
- Generative Adversarial Networks
- Deep reinforcement learning (Q-learning, actor-critic, policy gradient, experience replay, double Q-learning, deep bootstrap networks, generalized advantage estimation, dueling network, continuous control, Atari games, AlphaGo)
